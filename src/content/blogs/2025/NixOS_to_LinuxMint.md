# Nix\_to\_Mint
09-08-2025
Recently, I had set my laptop to be able to dual-boot **Windows 11** and **NixOS**. I had never dual-booted a system before but it was quite easy (but a little scary) to setup. Anytime I work with partitions I always fear that I am going to erase everything and the earth is going to explode. When it came to working inside NixOS, to say I was lost, in terms of customizing and altering the system to my needs, would be an understatement. The features of NixOS, being a deterministic system that allows for rollbacks in case of errors (_which I cause a lot of_), seemed like it would be perfect for me. However, I am still fairly new to linux in general and NixOS was quite confusing to me when attempting to rice. I understand I could just learn the system first and then rice but I want to be able to learn in an environment that I am confortable with. I also understand this is definitely a **skill-issue** and seeing how some people online are able to accomplish what takes me weeks in a matter of days also did not help in the learning process. That is also a lesson I would like to preach, **DON'T COMPARE YOURSELF TO OTHER DEVELOPERS/LINUX USERS!!!!** Comparison is the thief of joy and if you, a newbie like me, compare yourself to linux nerds online that have been working in it for 5+ years, _of course_ you will fall short.

I still wanted to learn in a comfortable environment however, and I was in search of a new distro. My second pc in my home setup was currently running Fedora 42 (with KDE Plasma) and I was loving it. It was close enough to Windows that I didn't feel like there was too much of a learning curve just to get comfortable. This was my top choice for what to boot on my laptop but I also wanted to try something new. **Linux Mint**, or _Lint_ as I will come to call it, was something I had my eye on as I saw it was very user friendly and works straight out of the box. What ended up sealing my decision however was Mr. Robot. I was watching it at the time of looking at the new distros and at this point I was back and forth on Fedora and Lint and then the TV gave me a sign. It pans over to Elliot's home terminal and on it, he's running Lint! At that point I knew that was what I needed.

That same night, I created a bootable drive with **Etcher** and cleaned and replaced the partition that contained NixOS. The install was very simple and straightforward. The UI for Lint is very minimal, like a blank Windows setup (minus all the _bloat_ that windows comes with). After some basic customization, I came up with this setup.

I know compared to most _hyprland crazy rices_ this is doodoo. But for me, this is really all I need. I set in some keybinds that mimic some of the features of hyprland that I like **PLUS** I get all of the standard features of Lint. I tried adding an extension for the transparent panel bar at the bottom but it seems to have some issues. I will try to get that working but for now, I am happy with the setup. I also have a semi transparent vscode that I edit code in. This reminds me of those setups in empty living rooms with just a foldable chair and the tv on the floor, _and I love it_. Also, _yes I live in Owensboro_.

I can see myself using Lint for quite some time. I have yet to experience an issue (which its only been a couple of days), but I have a good feeling about this distro. Also, I suppose I should explain why I want to get into Linux in the first place. I have been rewatching the show **Mr. Robot** as I mentioned before but this time I have been wanting to learn more about the tools and real world applications used within the show as it is the most _accurate_ depiction of hacking on television. I have always had an interest in cyber security and even cracked a few WiFi's back on my old laptop when I was running a **Kali** VM (Don't worry, they were my family's WiFi routers, I had permission). Now that I have finished school and started a career in the tech field, that interest has grown much larger and I now want to get my hands dirty in the Linux space.

In an older article, I talked about setting up a VPN on my home network using OpenVPN. I am going to attempt to do that with this new install and hopefully get it working without spending a linux evening. Once that is done, and potentially even before its done, I want to connect and create an IRC channel for me and my friends to communicate on. Stay tuned for that one. With that, we're done!
