# NixOS_Rice
09-04-2025
I have always been semi-obsessed with [r/unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/) (_I know that sounds weird it's not what you think_) but I have never been quite good at ricing my own system. I always end up breaking my distro and have to spend a linux evening on it. Originally, my first distro was Arch (**I _used_ arch btw**) and that was a _graveeee_ mistake. I was already on a path to building a second pc exclusively for linux, when Pewdiepie dropped his linux video out of nowhere. At the time, I was settled on **Fedora 42** as my distro but after watching his video, I was convinced to get **Arch** first.

Now I am a little bit of a brainlet and thought that ChatGPT could help me get through the setup and ricing of my Arch system, and it did for the most part, but I felt like I knew _nothing_ about my own system. I was also still pretty uncomfortable with linux overall and Arch did not make it any easier. I was so lost and travelling down so many rabbit holes it was constant headache after headache and of course listening to ChatGPT spit out nonsense most of the time did NOT help those headaches. I decided to take a step back and remove arch and return to the orignal love I had for Fedora (I had never used it just seeing it in videos drew me to it).

With Fedora, I instantly felt more comfortable. I went with the **KDE Plasma** install over the GNOME purely for the looks and feel. To me, GNOME just reminds me of Ubuntu which if I am being honest, I absolutely despise (This is due to my operating systems class in college). To this day I am rocking Fedora 42 (it's been about a month lol) and I am still enjoying it. I have done _minimal_ ricing (if you can even call what I did ricing) which includes making my kitty terminal slightly see through! :|

Though I have done hardly anything with my Fedora setup, I still quite enjoy it. I think that gives more credit to Fedora out of the box than the lack of ability I have for ricing. Nonetheless, I wanted to become familiar with it but instead of breaking my Fedora box, which was currently hosting my friends and I's minecraft server, I decided to turn to my laptop that I hadn't used since college. There was nothing wrong with my laptop but since starting work, I have had either my work laptop or my desktop as my main stations of operation. I actually quite like my **ASUS Zenbook** laptop but only really used it for my DnD campaign at the time.

Knowing now that I was going to install a Linux distro onto my Windows laptop, I had the daunting task of deciding which one I would go with and how I would put it onto the device (I did not know about dual booting at this time). I had previously seen a video by [Forrest Knight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmFjV3_iIn0) that got me into the idea of having a dual pc setup and in that video he used **NixOS**. Doing a little more research into the distro, it seemed like it was exactly what I needed with its multiple iteration and declaritive design it made it very difficult for me to break things in an unrepairable manner. Even if I did, I would be able to rollback to the previously stable version and go from there.

The time came and I was able to follow [a guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qypfkDx\_Qnc) to get NixOS dual booted onto my Windows 11 laptop (the guide is for Ubuntu but the concept is the same). NixOS was now a bootable option (after disabling secure boot on windows cuz it didn't like its new neighbor) and I was ready to get into it. The first thing I needed to think of was what exactly am I going to do with this laptop? Is this going to be for development? For writing? For purely reading degenerate manga? I didn't really know at the time but I new I wanted it to be **_aesthetic_**. So I began doing exactly what I did before, not learning my lesson, and asking ChatGPT, "Hey here is a screenshot of someones riced NixOS. How do I do this?".

With this method, I actually got a pretty good rice going. ![Portal Desktop SS](/images/secluded-grove-pixel.png)
However, this was put together purely with duct tape and spit (and hopes and dreams) and was not stable at all. It felt like at any moment, something could go wrong and my entire laptop explodes and destroys everything I know and love. That, and I felt like I was missing the whole point of NixOS and the use of **Flakes** and **home-manager**, that being that it is highly portable and contained. My system felt as if it was just a large gas leak that was slowly killing everything. Each time I tried rebuilding the system, I would always get an error about the backups and have to manually delete some folders in order to build the new one and it was just such a hassle. So, I have decided to start over and really give it some time and _learn_ exactly what it is I need to do to make this efficient, smooth, and **_aesthetic_**.
