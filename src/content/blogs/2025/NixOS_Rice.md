# NixOS_Rice
09-06-2025
I have always been semi-obsessed with [r/unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/) (_I know that sounds weird it's not what you think_) but I have never been quite good at ricing my own system. I always end up breaking my distro and have to spend a linux evening on it. Originally, my first distro was Arch (**I _used_ arch btw**) and that was a _graveeee_ mistake. I was already on a path to building a second pc exclusively for linux, when Pewdiepie dropped his linux video out of nowhere. At the time, I was settled on **Fedora 42** as my distro but after watching his video, I was convinced to get **Arch** first.

Now I am a little bit of a brainlet and thought that ChatGPT could help me get through the setup and ricing of my Arch system, and it did for the most part, but I felt like I knew _nothing_ about my own system. I was also still pretty uncomfortable with linux overall and Arch did not make it any easier. I was so lost and travelling down so many rabbit holes it was constant headache after headache and of course listening to ChatGPT spit out nonsense most of the time did NOT help those headaches. I decided to take a step back and remove arch and return to the orignal love I had for Fedora (I had never used it just seeing it in videos drew me to it).

With Fedora, I instantly felt more comfortable. I went with the **KDE Plasma** install over the GNOME purely for the looks and feel. To me, GNOME just reminds me of Ubuntu which if I am being honest, I absolutely despise (This is due to my operating systems class in college). To this day I am rocking Fedora 42 (it's been about a month lol) and I am still enjoying it. I have done _minimal_ ricing (if you can even call what I did ricing) which includes making my kitty terminal slightly see through! :|

Though I have done hardly anything with my Fedora setup, I still quite enjoy it. I think that gives more credit to Fedora out of the box than the lack of ability I have for ricing. Nonetheless, I wanted to become familiar with it but instead of breaking my Fedora box, which was currently hosting my friends and I's minecraft server, I decided to turn to my laptop that I hadn't used since college. There was nothing wrong with my laptop but since starting work, I have had either my work laptop or my desktop as my main stations of operation. I actually quite like my **ASUS Zenbook** laptop but only really used it for my DnD campaign at the time.

# Why NixOS?
Knowing now that I was going to install a Linux distro onto my Windows laptop, I had the daunting task of deciding which one I would go with and how I would put it onto the device (I did not know about dual booting at this time). I had previously seen a video by [Forrest Knight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmFjV3_iIn0) that got me into the idea of having a dual pc setup and in that video he used **NixOS**. Doing a little more research into the distro, it seemed like it was exactly what I needed with its multiple iteration and declaritive design it made it very difficult for me to break things in an unrepairable manner. Even if I did, I would be able to rollback to the previously stable version and go from there.

The time came and I was able to follow [a guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qypfkDx\_Qnc) to get NixOS dual booted onto my Windows 11 laptop (the guide is for Ubuntu but the concept is the same). NixOS was now a bootable option (after disabling secure boot on windows cuz it didn't like its new neighbor) and I was ready to get into it. The first thing I needed to think of was what exactly am I going to do with this laptop? Is this going to be for development? For writing? For purely reading degenerate manga? I didn't really know at the time but I new I wanted it to be **_aesthetic_**. So I began doing exactly what I did before, not learning my lesson, and asking ChatGPT, "Hey here is a screenshot of someones riced NixOS. How do I do this?".

With this method, I actually got a pretty good rice going. ![Portal Desktop SS](/images/PortalSS.png)
However, this was put together purely with duct tape and spit (and hopes and dreams) and was not stable at all. It felt like at any moment, something could go wrong and my entire laptop explodes and destroys everything I know and love. That, and I felt like I was missing the whole point of NixOS and the use of **Flakes** and **home-manager**, that being that it is highly portable and contained. My system felt as if it was just a large gas leak that was slowly killing everything. Each time I tried rebuilding the system, I would always get an error about the backups and have to manually delete some folders in order to build the new one and it was just such a hassle. So, I have decided to start over and really give it some time and _learn_ exactly what it is I need to do to make this efficient, smooth, and **_aesthetic_**. 


# The Process
The thing I really struggled with the first time was getting home-manager and flakes to work alongside each other. I had no experience setting these up and diving into the rabbit hole that is the documentation, I got lost. Thankfully, I found a wonderful [guide](https://github.com/Evertras/simple-homemanager/tree/main) that really helped me and cleared things up about the setup. This is very minimal, just setting up home-manager and flakes and not so much other ricing techniques. Nonetheless, it is **_exactly_** what I needed. With these two setup properly, it was time to get into actually customizing it for my liking. 

Browsing [r/unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/), I was able to find some features that I was really interested in. Back when I was on Arch, I used Hyprland but again, it was put together using duct tape if even that. I know Hyprland can be a little more demanding but the features really are endless. The one thing that I really wanted to keep in my system was a taskbar. Most Hyprland setups I see don't actually have this but I found one post from [u/Lumpy-Ad](https://www.reddit.com/user/Lumpy-Ad-9813/) that has most of the features that I am looking for. Below is their main desktop.

I started with the main [documentation](https://wiki.hypr.land/Nix/Hyprland-on-Home-Manager/) that can be found on hyprlands website that is specific for NixOS. However, when following the instructions, I kept getting an error regarding "inputs" within the flake.nix file. After spending a lot of time trying to figure out what could be causing this, I believe I found that it was the way my flakes and home-manager were setup from the beginning. This wasn't too bad however and I found a [tutorial from Vimjoyer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt3hgSBs11g) that walked me through the basics. Again however, there were some things from this tutorial that did not work for me. I had to alter my code a little and use the default stable hyprland packages with my home-manager in order for anything to work (I think this is because I am using the stable version of NixOS). After messing around with that and adding the following lines to my **configuration.nix** file:
```
programs.hyprland.enable = true;
programs.hyprland.package = pkgs.hyprland;
```
I was able to rebuild and select hyprland as my DM (display manager) on login. Though I did run into an issue at this point; **I HAD NO KEYBINDS!!** I was essentially trapped within hyprland but by powering off and reselecting KDE Plasma, I could go in and add a few basic keybinds to hyprland to make it functional.

In that tutorial by Vimjoyer, he showed off a plugin for **borders-plus-plus** that was supposed to round out the borders of my applications and give them a color. However this was the result:

As you can see, they are about as round as an arrow.

I decided instead, just so I can see what ricing can be like on my machine, to try and find a repository that helped guide me through the install of their flake files. I eventually came across one that I really liked made by [Sly-Harvey](https://github.com/Sly-Harvey/NixOS). It followed the theme of black holes (or others if you preffered), and had a really easy to follow setup guide. Simply just create a directory to store the repository in, configure the configuration file and the flake file to your system settings and drop in your hardware-configuration file and run an install script. Once that is done, restart the machine and you will be met with a gorgeous login screen as well as a hyprland setup.

I know this isn't my own setup and I do plan on making my own when I better understand how to do so but for now, this is an enjoyable rice that I can work with. Until then, thats all for this one.

GGs gamers!
