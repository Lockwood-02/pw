# Mechanical_Keyboards
09-12-2025
If you read my [about me](/about) page, you would know that I build mechanical keyboards. This _potentially_ expensive hobby all started from one [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3Fy4PkpTVs&pp=ygUWYnVpbGRpbmcgdGZ1ZSBrZXlib2FyZA%3D%3D). I'm sure that video also got a lot of people into mechanical keyboards as it was _very_ popular. I think it all stemed from the sounds of the board. I fell in love with **thock** in that moment. At this time, I was still in my freshman year of college with no money and no job. Even still, I really wanted to make a keyboard. I found a really cheap kit from [KBDFans](https://kbdfans.com/) and began putting together my first board.

Unfortunately, I made this board before I really started keeping notes of every detail about them but here is the gist of what the board consists of:
- KBD67r II build kit
- Gateron yellow switches (unlubed)
- White Japanese keycaps from amazon
