# MR\_ROBOT\_2.4
In my many, _many_ rewatches of this show, I always just saw the hacking portion and stood in awe. For this rewatch, however, I decided to do some more learning about the different topics and ideas that are presented. In this episode, Elliot logs onto Ray's computer (I won't get into spoiler territory) and logs into what I assume to be his home machine with PuTTY and connected to an IRC channel that consisted of only him and Darlene. Neglecting the fact that it would mean he would have had to have his pc running the entire time he was gone in order to connect to his system, I decided to try and replicate the series of events myself.

## Setup
I recently built a second pc which runs Fedora 42 linux. I keep it on practically 24/7 due to a minecraft server that demands that attention. This allows me to connect to it whenever I want. This makes it a perfect target device for what we will be experimenting with. The device we will be connecting onto the target machine with is my personal laptop (**an ASUS Zenbook**) that is running NixOS. Since we are connecting Linux to Linux, I do not believe we will need PuTTY. Linux has built in SSH components that will allow us to complete this without needing to download any software.
