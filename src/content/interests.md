# Interests
Instead of keeping folders upon folders of bookmarks for things that I might be interested in, I decided to put them all into one page. They are somewhat categorized and hopefully still up and running. This might also help you get to know my interest a little bit more so there's that if you ever want to spark up a conversation. 

Happy browsing!
