# Hello, World.
I'm **Isaac Lockwood** â€” full-stack dev & GIS tinkerer. I build terminal-style UIs, mapping tools, and moody sci-fi worlds. I recently received my Masters degree in computer science and somehow broke through the tech job market barrier. I am also Big Joe certified so yeah, _I am the coolest_.
