# Hello, World.
I'm **Isaac Lockwood** â€” full-stack dev & GIS tinkerer. I build terminal-style UIs, mapping tools, and moody sci-fi worlds. I recently received my Masters degree in computer science and somehow broke through the tech job market barrier. I build mechanical keyboards on the side so going to an office that has a stereotypical logitech grease board, it pains me so much. Just a tip if you ever touch a high end keyboard, be prepared to never go back to the standard. I am also Big Joe certified so yeah, _I am the coolest_.
